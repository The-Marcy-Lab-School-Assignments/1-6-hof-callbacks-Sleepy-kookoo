# Question
What is an "inline function"? Give an example with your definition.

# Answer
    An "inline function" is writing your code into the argument instead of a callback function. 

    let sum = function (a, b) {
        return a + b
    }

# Teacher Feedback

Your definition makes sense however your example is just showing the callback function! It is not in the context of a higher order function. Here is what an example could look like: 

`const screamAtEveryone = (msg, () => {`${msg}.toUpperCase()`});`
